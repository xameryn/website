      <h1>Rasa Novum's Core Philosophies:</h1>
      <ul><li><strong>#1 - Incentivise Infrastructure</strong></li></ul>
      <p>Players are encouraged to build infrastructure that benefits the community. This can be anything from a public farm, to a fast travel system, to a community storage area. We want to reward players for going above and beyond to help the server grow.</p>
      <ul><li><strong>#2 - Encourage Community</strong></li></ul>
      <p>Players are encouraged to work together to build towns, cities, and nations. We want players to feel like they are part of something bigger than themselves, and that they are making a difference in the world.</p>
      <ul><li><strong>#3 - Promote Server Longevity</strong></li></ul>
      <p>We want players to stick around for the long haul. We will make changes to the server to keep things fresh and interesting, and to keep players engaged and excited to play.</p>
      <ul><li><strong>#4 - Minecraft Isn't Perfect</strong></li></ul>
      <p>Minecraft is a great game but is inherently flawed as far as balance goes. We will make changes we see as an improvement regardless of how intrinsic a feature is to the base game.</p>
